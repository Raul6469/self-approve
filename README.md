A GitHub App built with Probot that checks if someone approved a pull request and authored commits in it. If so, the status is set to failure. This way, you can always be sure to have a fresh review before merging!

## Use

The GitHub app is currently private, because I'm still searching the server on which I'll deploy it. You will have to run your own instance to make it work for you at the moment.

## Contributing :tada:
This is the very beginning of the project, so I will be more than happy to hear your suggestions (issues or PRs)!

Ideas include:
  - enforcing a minimum number of positive reviews
  - supporting a yml config file
  - _... yours!_
