A GitHub App built with Probot that checks if someone approved a pull request and authored commits in it. If so, the status is set to failure. This way, you can always be sure to have a fresh review before merging!

## Use

The GitHub app is public, but running on a limited server. This is meant for test purposes only, and the app can be shut down at any moment without notice. So feel free to experiment, but until I find a better server, this is not meant for a real use.

## Contributing :tada:
This is the very beginning of the project, so I will be more than happy to hear your suggestions (issues or PRs)!

Ideas include:
  - enforcing a minimum number of positive reviews
  - supporting a yml config file
  - _... yours!_
